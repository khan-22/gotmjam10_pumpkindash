# PUMPKIN DASH
An entry for Gotm-jam #10

## About
Through mysterious circumstances; you, a pumpkin, have gained consciousness!
Unfortunately for you, someone has already made plans for you...
Can you **escape** the magical onslaught?

## How to play
Use WASD, arrow keys or Dpad to move around
(Controller should technically be supported, but I've only playtested using keyboard input so I highly recommend you use it too)

Simply survive until the end. There are three phases of increasing difficulty you must pass in order to win.

## Credits
All assets, including sprites, music and sound effects made by me.
Special thanks to Raidak for creative input.
